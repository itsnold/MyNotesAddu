## Why Propositional Logic Isn't Enough

Consider this classic argument:
- "All men are mortal."
- "Socrates is a man."
- Therefore: "Socrates is mortal."

This can't be represented in propositional logic. We need a language that talks about **objects**, their **properties**, and their **relations**. That's where predicate logic comes in.

## Predicate Logic Basics

Predicate logic introduces:

> [!info] New Features
> **Variables:** $x, y, z$ — represent objects from a domain
> 
> **Predicates:** $P(x), M(x)$ — properties that can be true or false
> 
> **Quantifiers:** $\forall$ (for all), $\exists$ (there exists)

---

## Propositional Functions

A **propositional function** contains variables and a predicate, like $P(x)$. It becomes a proposition (with a truth value) when the variable is replaced by a value from the domain.

> [!definition] Propositional Function
> $P(x)$ is the value of the propositional function $P$ at $x$.
> 
> The **domain** (often denoted $U$) is the set of possible values for the variable.

> [!example] Example
> Let $P(x)$ denote "$x > 0$" with domain = integers.
> 
> $P(-3)$ is **false**
> $P(0)$ is **false**
> $P(3)$ is **true**

> [!example] Multi-variable Example
> Let $R(x, y, z)$ denote "$x + y = z$" with $U$ = integers.
> 
> $R(2, -1, 5)$ → **F** (since $2 + (-1) = 1 \neq 5$)
> $R(3, 4, 7)$ → **T** (since $3 + 4 = 7$)
> $R(x, 3, z)$ → **Not a proposition** (variables aren't bound)

### Compound Expressions

Connectives from propositional logic carry over. If $P(x)$ denotes "$x > 0$":

| Expression | Value |
|---|:---:|
| $P(3) \lor P(-1)$ | T |
| $P(3) \land P(-1)$ | F |
| $P(3) \to P(-1)$ | F |
| $P(3) \to \neg P(-1)$ | T |

But expressions with free variables like $P(3) \land P(y)$ or $P(x) \to P(y)$ are **not propositions** until the variables are bound.

## Quantifiers

We need quantifiers to express words like "all" and "some."

> [!abstract] The Two Quantifiers
> | Symbol | Name | Meaning |
> |:---:|---|---|
> | $\forall$ | Universal | "For all" — $\forall x\, P(x)$ means $P(x)$ is true for **every** $x$ |
> | $\exists$ | Existential | "There exists" — $\exists x\, P(x)$ means $P(x)$ is true for **some** $x$ |
> 
> The quantifier **binds** the variable $x$.

### Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)

$\forall x\, P(x)$ is read "For all $x$, $P(x)$" or "For every $x$, $P(x)$."

> [!example] Universal Examples
> Let $P(x)$ = "$x > 0$"
> 
> If $U$ = integers: $\forall x\, P(x)$ is **false** (negative integers exist)
> 
> If $U$ = positive integers: $\forall x\, P(x)$ is **true**

### Existential Quantifier ($\exists$)

$\exists x\, P(x)$ is read "There exists an $x$ such that $P(x)$" or "For some $x$, $P(x)$."

> [!example] Existential Examples
> Let $P(x)$ = "$x > 0$"
> 
> If $U$ = integers: $\exists x\, P(x)$ is **true**
> 
> Let $P(x)$ = "$x < 0$"
> 
> If $U$ = positive integers: $\exists x\, P(x)$ is **false**

### Quantifiers as Conjunctions/Disjunctions

If the domain is finite, you can think of:
- $\forall x\, P(x)$ as $P(x_1) \land P(x_2) \land \ldots \land P(x_n)$
- $\exists x\, P(x)$ as $P(x_1) \lor P(x_2) \lor \ldots \lor P(x_n)$

### Precedence

Quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$ have **higher precedence** than all logical operators.

So $\forall x\, P(x) \lor Q(x)$ means $(\forall x\, P(x)) \lor Q(x)$, not $\forall x\, (P(x) \lor Q(x))$.

## Negating Quantified Expressions

> [!info]+ 📊 De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers
> ![[attachments/quantifier_negation.png]]
> *Negation flips the quantifier and negates the predicate*

> [!abstract] De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers
> | Statement | Equivalent |
> |---|---|
> | $\neg \forall x\, P(x)$ | $\exists x\, \neg P(x)$ |
> | $\neg \exists x\, P(x)$ | $\forall x\, \neg P(x)$ |
> 
> "Not all" = "There exists one that doesn't"
> "None exist" = "All don't"

> [!example] Negation Example
> Statement: "Every student in your class has taken Java."
> $\forall x\, J(x)$
> 
> Negation: "There is a student who has NOT taken Java."
> $\neg \forall x\, J(x) \equiv \exists x\, \neg J(x)$

---

## Translating English to Logic

The key is to first decide on the domain $U$.

> [!example] "Every student in this class has taken Java"
> **Option 1:** If $U$ = students in this class
> $\forall x\, J(x)$
> 
> **Option 2:** If $U$ = all people
> $\forall x\, (S(x) \to J(x))$
> where $S(x)$ = "$x$ is a student in this class"

> [!example] "Some student in this class has taken Java"
> **Option 1:** If $U$ = students in this class
> $\exists x\, J(x)$
> 
> **Option 2:** If $U$ = all people
> $\exists x\, (S(x) \land J(x))$

> [!warning] Pattern to Remember
> "All A are B" → $\forall x\, (A(x) \to B(x))$ — uses **implication**
> 
> "Some A are B" → $\exists x\, (A(x) \land B(x))$ — uses **conjunction**

### More Translation Examples

Using domain $U$ = {fleegles, snurds, thingamabobs}

| English | Logic |
|---|---|
| "Everything is a fleegle" | $\forall x\, F(x)$ |
| "Nothing is a snurd" | $\neg \exists x\, S(x) \equiv \forall x\, \neg S(x)$ |
| "All fleegles are snurds" | $\forall x\, (F(x) \to S(x))$ |
| "Some fleegles are thingamabobs" | $\exists x\, (F(x) \land T(x))$ |
| "No snurd is a thingamabob" | $\neg \exists x\, (S(x) \land T(x)) \equiv \forall x\, (\neg S(x) \lor \neg T(x))$ |
| "If any fleegle is a snurd, it's also a thingamabob" | $\forall x\, ((F(x) \land S(x)) \to T(x))$ |

## Returning to Socrates

Now we can express the classic argument:

Let $Man(x)$ = "$x$ is a man", $Mortal(x)$ = "$x$ is mortal", domain = all people.

> [!abstract] The Argument
> **Premise 1:** $\forall x\, (Man(x) \to Mortal(x))$ — "All men are mortal"
> 
> **Premise 2:** $Man(Socrates)$ — "Socrates is a man"
> 
> **Conclusion:** $Mortal(Socrates)$ — "Socrates is mortal"

## Exercises

Translate each statement into logical expressions using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.

**Setup:** Let $U$ = all people, $F(x)$ = "$x$ is your friend", $P(x)$ = "$x$ is perfect"

> [!example] Exercise 1 — "No one is perfect."
> This means there does not exist anyone who is perfect.
> 
> $\neg \exists x\, P(x)$
> 
> Equivalently: $\forall x\, \neg P(x)$ — "Everyone is not perfect"

> [!example] Exercise 2 — "Not everyone is perfect."
> This means it is not the case that all people are perfect.
> 
> $\neg \forall x\, P(x)$
> 
> Equivalently: $\exists x\, \neg P(x)$ — "There exists someone who is not perfect"
> 
> Note: This is different from "No one is perfect" — here at least one person might still be perfect.

> [!example] Exercise 3 — "All your friends are perfect."
> For all $x$, if $x$ is your friend, then $x$ is perfect.
> 
> $\forall x\, (F(x) \to P(x))$
> 
> Uses implication because it's an "All A are B" statement.

> [!example] Exercise 4 — "At least one of your friends is perfect."
> There exists an $x$ such that $x$ is your friend AND $x$ is perfect.
> 
> $\exists x\, (F(x) \land P(x))$
> 
> Uses conjunction because it's a "Some A are B" statement.

> [!example] Exercise 5 — "Everyone is your friend and is perfect."
> For all $x$, $x$ is your friend AND $x$ is perfect.
> 
> $\forall x\, (F(x) \land P(x))$
> 
> This is stronger than Exercise 3 — it says everyone (not just friends) satisfies both properties.

> [!example] Exercise 6 — "Not everybody is your friend or someone is not perfect."
> This is a disjunction of two parts:
> - "Not everybody is your friend" = $\neg \forall x\, F(x)$
> - "Someone is not perfect" = $\exists x\, \neg P(x)$
> 
> $\neg \forall x\, F(x) \lor \exists x\, \neg P(x)$
> 
> Equivalently: $\exists x\, \neg F(x) \lor \exists x\, \neg P(x)$
