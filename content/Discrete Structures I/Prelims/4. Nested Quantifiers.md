## Why Nest Quantifiers?

Sometimes one quantifier isn't enough. When we want to express more complex ideas, like "every real number has an inverse", we need to stack them.

> [!example] Basic Nested Quantifier
> "Every real number has an inverse" becomes:
> $$\forall x \exists y(x + y = 0)$$
> where the domain of $x$ and $y$ is the real numbers.
> 
> Breaking it down: For every $x$, there exists some $y$ such that $x + y = 0$.

Nested quantifiers can be viewed as nested propositional functions:
- $\forall x \exists y(x + y = 0)$ can be viewed as $\forall x\, Q(x)$
- where $Q(x)$ is $\exists y\, P(x, y)$
- where $P(x, y)$ is $(x + y = 0)$

Just layering predicates on top of each other. The outer quantifier "wraps" the inner one.

## Order of Quantifiers

The **order matters** when using different quantifiers. If they're the same quantifiers you can swap them. If they're different ones, you can't.

> [!info]+ 📊 Quantifier Order Overview
> ![[attachments/quantifier_order.png]]
> *Same quantifiers can swap; mixed quantifiers cannot*

> [!info] When Order Doesn't Matter
> $\forall x \forall y\, P(x,y) \equiv \forall y \forall x\, P(x,y)$
> 
> $\exists x \exists y\, P(x,y) \equiv \exists y \exists x\, P(x,y)$
> 
> Same type of quantifier = order is interchangeable.

> [!warning] When Order DOES Matter
> $\forall x \exists y\, P(x,y) \not\equiv \exists y \forall x\, P(x,y)$
> 
> Mixing $\forall$ and $\exists$ = order changes the meaning!

> [!example] Order Matters
> Let $Q(x,y)$ be "$x + y = 0$" with $U$ = real numbers.
> 
> | Statement | Meaning | Truth Value |
> |---|---|:---:|
> | $\forall x \exists y\, Q(x,y)$ | "For every $x$, there's a $y$ making $x + y = 0$" | ✅ True |
> | $\exists y \forall x\, Q(x,y)$ | "There's one $y$ that works for ALL $x$" | ❌ False |
> 
> The first is true because every number has an inverse. The second is false because no single $y$ can be the inverse of *every* $x$.

### Practice Problems

> [!example] Example 1: Multiplication by Zero
> Let $U$ = real numbers, $P(x,y) : x \cdot y = 0$
> 
> | Statement | Truth Value | Why? |
> |---|:---:|---|
> | $\forall x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ | ❌ False | Not every pair multiplies to 0 (e.g., $2 \cdot 3 \neq 0$) |
> | $\forall x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ | ✅ True | For any $x$, just pick $y = 0$ |
> | $\exists x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ | ✅ True | $x = 0$ works for all $y$ |
> | $\exists x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ | ✅ True | $x = 0, y = 0$ works |

> [!example] Example 2: Division Equals One
> Let $U$ = real numbers, $P(x,y) : x / y = 1$
> 
> | Statement | Truth Value | Why? |
> |---|:---:|---|
> | $\forall x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ | ❌ False | Obviously not all divisions equal 1 |
> | $\forall x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ | ❌ False | $x = 0$ has no $y$ such that $0/y = 1$ |
> | $\exists x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ | ❌ False | No single $x$ divided by all $y$ gives 1 |
> | $\exists x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ | ✅ True | $x = 1, y = 1$ works |

## Quantifications of Two Variables

Different quantifier combinations have different "strengths." $\forall x \forall y$ is the strongest claim (must hold for all pairs), while $\exists x \exists y$ is the weakest (just needs one pair to work).

> [!info]+ 📊 Two Variable Quantification Grid
> ![[attachments/quantification_grid.png]]
> *Stronger claims at top-left, weaker at bottom-right*

> [!abstract] Truth Conditions Summary
> | Statement | When True | When False |
> |:---|:---|:---|
> | $\forall x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ | $P(x,y)$ is true for **every** pair $x, y$ | There exists a pair where $P(x,y)$ is false |
> | $\forall x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ | For every $x$, there's **some** $y$ making it true | There's an $x$ with no suitable $y$ |
> | $\exists x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ | There's an $x$ that works for **all** $y$ | For every $x$, some $y$ makes it false |
> | $\exists x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ | There's **at least one** pair where it's true | It's false for every pair |

> [!tip] Reading Tip
> Read left to right, inside to outside. "$\forall x \exists y$" = "For every $x$, there exists a $y$..."

## Translating Nested Quantifiers to English

Going from symbols to words. Work from the outermost quantifier inward, translating each piece. The structure of the formula mirrors the structure of the English sentence.

> [!example] Translation Example
> $$\forall x (C(x) \lor \exists y (C(y) \land F(x, y)))$$
> 
> Where:
> - $C(x)$ = "$x$ has a computer"
> - $F(x,y)$ = "$x$ and $y$ are friends"
> - Domain = all students in your school
> 
> **Translation:** "Every student in your school has a computer or has a friend who has a computer."
> 
> Breaking it down:
> - $\forall x$ → "For every student..."
> - $C(x) \lor ...$ → "...either they have a computer OR..."
> - $\exists y (C(y) \land F(x, y))$ → "...there exists someone who has a computer AND is their friend"

## Translating English to Predicate Logic

Going the other direction. The trick is to identify the quantifiers hiding in plain English. Words like "every," "all," "any" suggest $\forall$. Words like "some," "there exists," "at least one" suggest $\exists$.

> [!example] Math Statement Translation
> **English:** "The sum of two positive integers is always positive."
> 
> **Step 1:** Make the quantifiers explicit
> → "For every two integers, if they are both positive, then their sum is positive."
> 
> **Step 2:** Introduce variables and domain
> → "For all integers $x$ and $y$, if $x > 0$ and $y > 0$, then $x + y > 0$."
> 
> **Step 3:** Write in logic
> $$\forall x \forall y ((x > 0) \land (y > 0) \to (x + y > 0))$$
> where the domain is all integers.

> [!example] Complex Translation: Airlines
> **English:** "There is a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world."
> 
> **Setup:**
> - $P(w,f)$ = "$w$ has taken flight $f$"
> - $Q(f,a)$ = "$f$ is a flight on airline $a$"
> - Domain of $w$ = all women
> - Domain of $f$ = all flights
> - Domain of $a$ = all airlines
> 
> **Logic:**
> $$\exists w \forall a \exists f (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$$
> 
> Read it: "There exists a woman such that for every airline, there exists a flight that she has taken AND that flight is on that airline."

### Quick Translation Practice

> [!example] Common Patterns
> | English | Logic |
> |---|---|
> | "Brothers are siblings." | $\forall x \forall y (B(x,y) \to S(x,y))$ |
> | "Siblinghood is symmetric." | $\forall x \forall y (S(x,y) \to S(y,x))$ |
> | "Everybody loves somebody." | $\forall x \exists y\, L(x,y)$ |
> | "There is someone who is loved by everyone." | $\exists y \forall x\, L(x,y)$ |
> | "There is someone who loves someone." | $\exists x \exists y\, L(x,y)$ |
> | "Everyone loves himself." | $\forall x\, L(x,x)$ |

Notice how "everybody loves somebody" ($\forall x \exists y$) is very different from "there is someone loved by everyone" ($\exists y \forall x$). The first says each person has *their own* someone; the second says there's *one person* loved by all.

## Negating Nested Quantifiers

Same idea as before with De Morgan's Laws for quantifiers, but now we apply them repeatedly. Each time we push the negation past a quantifier, we flip it ($\forall \leftrightarrow \exists$). Keep going until the negation reaches the innermost predicate.

> [!info]+ 📊 Negation Flow
> ![[attachments/nested_quantifier_negation.png]]
> *Push negation inward, flipping quantifiers as you go*

> [!abstract] De Morgan's for Nested Quantifiers
> Push negation inward:
> - $\neg \forall$ becomes $\exists \neg$
> - $\neg \exists$ becomes $\forall \neg$
> 
> Keep going until the negation reaches the predicate, then apply regular De Morgan's.

> [!example] Full Negation Walkthrough
> **Original:** "There is a woman who has taken a flight on every airline."
> $$\exists w \forall a \exists f (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$$
> 
> **Negation:** "There does NOT exist such a woman."
> $$\neg \exists w \forall a \exists f (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$$
> 
> **Push the negation inward step by step:**
> 
> | Step | Expression | Rule Applied |
> |:---:|---|---|
> | 1 | $\neg \exists w \forall a \exists f (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$ | Start |
> | 2 | $\forall w \neg \forall a \exists f (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$ | $\neg\exists \to \forall\neg$ |
> | 3 | $\forall w \exists a \neg \exists f (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$ | $\neg\forall \to \exists\neg$ |
> | 4 | $\forall w \exists a \forall f \neg (P(w,f) \land Q(f,a))$ | $\neg\exists \to \forall\neg$ |
> | 5 | $\forall w \exists a \forall f (\neg P(w,f) \lor \neg Q(f,a))$ | De Morgan's for $\land$ |
> 
> **Back to English:**
> "For every woman, there is an airline such that for all flights, this woman has not taken that flight OR that flight is not on this airline."
> 
> Basically: No matter which woman you pick, you can find an airline she hasn't fully covered.

## Exercises

> [!example] Exercise 1: Evaluate Truth Values
> Let $U$ = positive integers, $P(x,y) : x \leq y$
> 
> Determine the truth value:
> 1. $\forall x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ → **False** (not all pairs satisfy $x \leq y$)
> 2. $\forall x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ → **True** (for any $x$, pick $y = x$)
> 3. $\exists x \forall y\, P(x,y)$ → **True** ($x = 1$ works, since $1 \leq y$ for all positive $y$)
> 4. $\exists x \exists y\, P(x,y)$ → **True** ($x = 1, y = 2$ works)

> [!example] Exercise 2: Translate to Logic
> "Every student has taken at least one course."
> 
> Let $S(x)$ = "$x$ is a student", $C(y)$ = "$y$ is a course", $T(x,y)$ = "$x$ has taken $y$"
> 
> **Answer:** $\forall x (S(x) \to \exists y (C(y) \land T(x,y)))$

> [!example] Exercise 3: Negate and Simplify
> Negate: $\forall x \exists y\, P(x,y)$
> 
> **Answer:**
> $$\neg \forall x \exists y\, P(x,y) \equiv \exists x \neg \exists y\, P(x,y) \equiv \exists x \forall y \neg P(x,y)$$
> 
> "There exists an $x$ such that for all $y$, $P(x,y)$ is false."
