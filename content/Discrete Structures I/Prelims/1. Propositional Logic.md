## Introduction

So, logic gives precise meaning to mathematical statements, it's what helps us tell valid arguments from invalid ones. It's basically the foundation for understanding and constructing correct mathematical reasoning.

> [!tip] Applications
> Logic shows up everywhere in computer science: circuit design, program construction, correctness verification, and so on.

---

## Propositions

The basic unit of logic.

> [!definition] Proposition
> A declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**, but not both.

> [!example] Example 1 — These are propositions
> | Statement | Truth Value |
> |---|:---:|
> | Washington, D.C., is the capital of the USA. | ✅ True |
> | Toronto is the capital of Canada. | ❌ False |
> | $1 + 1 = 2$ | ✅ True |
> | $2 + 2 = 3$ | ❌ False |

> [!example] Example 2 — These are NOT propositions
> 1. "What time is it?" — it's a question, not declarative
> 2. "Read this carefully." — that's a command, not declarative
> 3. $x + 1 = 2$ — can't say true or false without knowing $x$
> 4. $x + y = z$ — same deal, depends on the variables

---

## Propositional Variables and Truth Values

We use letters like $p, q, r, s$ to represent propositions — these are called propositional variables.

> [!info] Notation
> **T** = True, **F** = False. Simple enough.

> [!quote]+ Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)
> Born in Stagirus, northern Greece. His father was physician to the King of Macedonia. He was orphaned young, went to Athens at 17, and joined Plato's Academy for 20 years.
> 
> Interesting — he didn't get picked to succeed Plato when he died, so he ended up tutoring Alexander the Great and eventually founded his own school (the Lyceum). His followers were called "peripatetics" because he liked walking around while discussing philosophy.
> 
> Wrote systematic treatises on logic, philosophy, psychology, physics, natural history — foundational stuff that lasted centuries.

## Logical Connectives

This whole area is called **propositional calculus** or **propositional logic**.

**Compound propositions** are just new propositions formed from existing ones using **logical operators** (also called connectives).

### Negation

> [!definition] Negation ($\neg$)
> $\neg p$ = "It is not the case that $p$" = "not $p$"
> 
> Just flips the truth value.

| $p$ | $\neg p$ |
|:---:|:---:|
| T | F |
| F | T |

> [!example] Example 3
> $p$ = "Michael's PC runs Linux"
> $\neg p$ = "Michael's PC does not run Linux"

> [!example] Example 4
> $p$ = "Vandana's smartphone has at least 32GB of memory"
> $\neg p$ = "Vandana's smartphone has less than 32GB of memory"

---

### Conjunction

> [!definition] Conjunction ($\land$)
> $p \land q$ = "$p$ and $q$"
> 
> Only true when **both** are true. Makes sense.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |

> [!example] Example 5
> $p$ = "Rebecca's PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space"
> $q$ = "The processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz"
> 
> $p \land q$ = "Rebecca's PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space **and** the processor runs faster than 1 GHz."

---

### Disjunction

> [!definition] Disjunction ($\lor$)
> $p \lor q$ = "$p$ or $q$"
> 
> Only false when **both** are false. This is the **inclusive or** — true when at least one is true.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \lor q$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |

> [!example] Example 6
> Same $p$ and $q$ from Example 5.
> 
> $p \lor q$ = "Rebecca's PC has at least 16 GB free **or** the processor runs faster than 1 GHz."
> 
> True if either condition holds, or if both do.

> [!tip] Inclusive vs. Exclusive "Or" in English
> Here's the thing — English is ambiguous about this:
> | Type | Example | Meaning |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Inclusive** | "Students who have taken calculus or CS can take this class." | Having both also counts |
> | **Exclusive** | "Soup or salad comes with an entrée." | One or the other, not both |

---

### Exclusive Or (XOR)

> [!abstract]+ 📊 OR vs XOR
> ![[attachments/or_vs_xor.png]]
> *∨ includes the overlap, ⊕ excludes it*

> [!definition] Exclusive Or ($\oplus$)
> $p \oplus q$ = true when **exactly one** of $p$ and $q$ is true. Not both.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \oplus q$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| T | T | F |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |

> [!abstract] $\lor$ vs. $\oplus$ — the difference
> | | Inclusive ($\lor$) | Exclusive ($\oplus$) |
> |---|:---:|:---:|
> | Both true | T | **F** |
> | One true | T | T |
> | Both false | F | F |

---

## Conditional Statements

> [!definition] Conditional ($\to$)
> $p \to q$ = "If $p$, then $q$"
> 
> It's only false when $p$ is true and $q$ is false. Otherwise it's true.
> 
> $p$ = **hypothesis** (also called antecedent or premise)
> $q$ = **conclusion** (also called consequence)

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \to q$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | **F** |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

> [!info] Different ways to say $p \to q$
> | | |
> |---|---|
> | if $p$, then $q$ | $p$ implies $q$ |
> | if $p$, $q$ | $p$ only if $q$ |
> | $p$ is sufficient for $q$ | a sufficient condition for $q$ is $p$ |
> | $q$ if $p$ | $q$ whenever $p$ |
> | $q$ when $p$ | $q$ is necessary for $p$ |
> | a necessary condition for $p$ is $q$ | $q$ follows from $p$ |
> | $q$ unless $\neg p$ | |

> [!example] Example 7
> $p$ = "Maria learns discrete mathematics"
> $q$ = "Maria will find a good job"
> 
> $p \to q$ = "If Maria learns discrete mathematics, then she will find a good job."
> 
> "Maria will find a good job **when** she learns discrete math." / "For Maria to get a good job, it's **sufficient** to learn discrete math." / "Maria will find a good job **unless** she doesn't learn discrete math."

> [!warning] About "only if" and "unless"
> "$p$ only if $q$" = $p \to q$
> Basically means $p$ can't be true when $q$ is false.
> 
> "$q$ unless $\neg p$" = $p \to q$
> If $\neg p$ is false (so $p$ is true), then $q$ has to be true.
> 
> ⚠️ Do NOT confuse "$p$ only if $q$" with "$q$ only if $p$". They're different!

> [!tip] Think of it like a promise
> Say a politician claims: "If I am elected, I will lower taxes."
> 
> | Scenario | Broken promise? |
> |---|:---:|
> | Elected, lowers taxes | ❌ Nope |
> | Elected, doesn't lower taxes | ✅ Yeah, that's a lie |
> | Not elected, lowers taxes anyway | ❌ Nope |
> | Not elected, doesn't lower taxes | ❌ Nope |
> 
> The promise only breaks when $p$ is true but $q$ is false.

> [!example] Example 8 — In programming
> ```
> if 2 + 2 = 4 then x := x + 1
> ```
> If $x = 0$ initially, what's $x$ after?
> 
> Well, $2 + 2 = 4$ is true, so the assignment runs. $x = 1$.

### Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse

Given $p \to q$, there are three related statements worth knowing:

> [!tip]+ 📊 Relationship Map
> ![[attachments/conditional_relationships.png]]
> *Diagonal pairs are equivalent; horizontal/vertical pairs are not*

> [!abstract] Related Statements
> | Name | Statement | Equivalent to $p \to q$? |
> |---|:---:|:---:|
> | **Original** | $p \to q$ | — |
> | **Converse** | $q \to p$ | ❌ |
> | **Inverse** | $\neg p \to \neg q$ | ❌ |
> | **Contrapositive** | $\neg q \to \neg p$ | ✅ |

So the **contrapositive** is logically equivalent to the original, that's the important one. The converse and inverse are equivalent to *each other*, but not to the original.

Common mistake: assuming the converse or inverse means the same as the original. It doesn't.

> [!example] Example 9
> Original: "The home team wins whenever it is raining."
> Rewriting: "If it is raining, then the home team wins."
> 
> | Type | Statement | Equivalent? |
> |---|---|:---:|
> | Contrapositive | "If the home team doesn't win, it's not raining." | ✅ |
> | Converse | "If the home team wins, it is raining." | ❌ |
> | Inverse | "If it's not raining, the home team doesn't win." | ❌ |

---

## Biconditionals

> [!definition] Biconditional ($\leftrightarrow$)
> $p \leftrightarrow q$ = "$p$ if and only if $q$"
> 
> True when $p$ and $q$ have the **same truth value**. Both true or both false.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | T |

> [!info] Ways to say it
> "$p$ is necessary and sufficient for $q$"
> "if $p$ then $q$, and conversely"
> "$p$ iff $q$"
> 
> By the way, it has the same truth value as $(p \to q) \land (q \to p)$.

> [!example] Example 10
> $p$ = "You can take the flight"
> $q$ = "You buy a ticket"
> 
> $p \leftrightarrow q$ = "You can take the flight if and only if you buy a ticket."
> 
> | Scenario | Truth Value |
> |---|:---:|
> | Buy ticket, can fly | ✅ |
> | No ticket, can't fly | ✅ |
> | Free trip (no ticket but can fly) | ❌ |
> | Airline bumps you (ticket but can't fly) | ❌ |

> [!warning] Natural language can be sneaky
> "If you finish your meal, you can have dessert."
> 
> In everyday speech, this usually means "if and only if", no dessert otherwise. But in logic we need to be precise about whether we mean $\to$ or $\leftrightarrow$.

## Truth Tables of Compound Propositions

You can figure out complex expressions by building up step by step.

> [!example] Example 11
> Truth table for $(p \lor \neg q) \to (p \land q)$:
> 
> | $p$ | $q$ | $\neg q$ | $p \lor \neg q$ | $p \land q$ | $(p \lor \neg q) \to (p \land q)$ |
> |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
> | T | T | F | T | T | **T** |
> | T | F | T | T | F | **F** |
> | F | T | F | F | F | **T** |
> | F | F | T | T | F | **F** |

## Precedence of Logical Operators

To avoid drowning in parentheses, operators follow a precedence order:

> [!info]+ 📊 Precedence Hierarchy
> ![[attachments/operator_precedence.png]]
> *Higher up = evaluated first*

> [!example] Examples
> | Expression | Actually means |
> |---|---|
> | $\neg p \land q$ | $(\neg p) \land q$ |
> | $p \land q \lor r$ | $(p \land q) \lor r$ |
> | $p \lor q \to r$ | $(p \lor q) \to r$ |
> 
> When in doubt, just throw in parentheses. Clarity helps.

## Logic and Bit Operations

Computers use **bits**, just 0 and 1.

> [!info] Truth values as bits
> | Truth | Bit |
> |:---:|:---:|
> | T | 1 |
> | F | 0 |
> 
> A **Boolean variable** holds true or false, which you can represent as a bit.

### Bit Operations

These work the same as logical connectives:

| $x$ | $y$ | OR | AND | XOR |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

### Bit Strings

> [!definition] Bit String
> Just a sequence of bits. The length is how many bits there are.

> [!example] Example 12
> `101010011` has length **9**.

> [!example] Example 13 — Bitwise operations
> Find OR, AND, XOR of `01 1011 0110` and `11 0001 1101`:
> ```
>      01 1011 0110
>      11 0001 1101
>      ────────────
> OR:  11 1011 1111
> AND: 01 0001 0100
> XOR: 10 1010 1011
> ```

## Exercises

> [!example] Exercise — Contrapositives
> ### a) If it snows today, I will ski tomorrow.
> **Contrapositive:** "If I do not ski tomorrow, then it did not snow today."
> 
> ### b) I come to class whenever there is going to be a quiz.
> **Contrapositive:** "If I do not come to class, then there is not going to be a quiz."

> [!example] Exercise — Translation
> **Statement:** "To use the wireless network in the airport you must pay the daily fee unless you are a subscriber to the service."
> 
> **Propositions:**
> - $w$: "You can use the wireless network in the airport"
> - $d$: "You pay the daily fee"
> - $s$: "You are a subscriber to the service"
> 
> **Answer:** $w \to (d \lor s)$
> 
> Alternatively: $(w \land \neg s) \to d$  "if you use the network and you're not a subscriber, then you pay." Both are logically equivalent.

> [!example] Exercise — Translation
> **Statement:** "You are eligible to be President of the U.S.A. only if you are at least 35 years old, were born in the U.S.A, or at the time of your birth both of your parents were citizens, and you have lived at least 14 years in the country."
> 
> **Propositions:**
> - $e$: "You are eligible to be President of the U.S.A."
