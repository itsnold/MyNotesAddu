## What are Fractals

Fractals are never-ending patterns that are infinitely complex and **self-similar** across different scales. They're created by repeating a simple process over and over in a feedback loop.

> [!definition] Self-Similarity
> A pattern is **self-similar** if it's congruent to a uniform scaling of itself.
> 
> Some fractals are only **self-affine** — their subunits are scaled by different amounts in different directions upon successive iterations.

So basically, zoom in on a fractal and you'll see the same pattern repeating at smaller scales.

## Fractals in Nature

> [!info]+ 📊 Self-Similarity in a Fern

> *The whole fern, pinnae, and pinnules all share the same shape at different scales*

A good example is a fern. The blade, pinnae (the leaflets), and pinnules (the smaller divisions) all have similar shapes but they do differ **ONLY** by size. That's self-similarity in nature.

> [!quote]+ Benoit Mandelbrot (1924–2010)
> The word "fractal" was coined in 1980 by Belgian mathematician **Benoit Mandelbrot**. He chose the name because it reminded him of "fraction", it was fitting since these self-similar shapes have fractional dimensions, not just 1D, 2D, or 3D.

## Fractal Dimension

Dimensions measure an object's size in one direction. Regular objects have integer dimensions (1D line, 2D square, 3D cube). But fractals have "in-between" dimensions.

### 1-Dimension (Line)

| Size ($s$) | Equal Parts ($n$) |
|:---:|:---:|
| $s = 1$ | $n = 1$ |
| $s = \frac{1}{2}$ | $n = 2$ |
| $s = \frac{1}{3}$ | $n = 3$ |

Cut a line in half → 2 pieces. Cut it in thirds → 3 pieces.

### 2-Dimension (Square)

| Size ($s$) | Equal Parts ($n$) |
|:---:|:---:|
| $s = 1$ | $n = 1$ |
| $s = \frac{1}{2}$ | $n = 4$ |
| $s = \frac{1}{3}$ | $n = 9$ |

Cut a square in half each direction → $2 \times 2 = 4$ pieces. In thirds → $3 \times 3 = 9$ pieces.

### 3-Dimension (Cube)

| Size ($s$) | Equal Parts ($n$) |
|:---:|:---:|
| $s = 1$ | $n = 1$ |
| $s = \frac{1}{2}$ | $n = 8$ |
| $s = \frac{1}{3}$ | $n = 27$ |

Cut a cube in half each direction → $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ pieces. In thirds → $3^3 = 27$ pieces.

### The Pattern

Notice:
- 1D: $n = 2^1, 3^1, \ldots$
- 2D: $n = 2^2, 3^2, \ldots$
- 3D: $n = 2^3, 3^3, \ldots$

The exponent is the dimension!

## Deriving the Dimension Formula

> [!info] Variables
> $D$ = dimensionality
> $n$ = number of equal pieces
> $s$ = size (length) of each piece
> $r$ = magnification factor = $\frac{1}{s}$

From the pattern above, the relationship is: $n = r^D$

**Solving for $D$:**

$$n = r^D$$

Take log of both sides:
$$\log n = \log r^D$$

Apply power rule:
$$\log n = D \log r$$

Divide by $\log r$:
$$D = \frac{\log n}{\log r}$$

> [!abstract] Fractal Dimension Formula
> $$D = \frac{\log n}{\log r} = \frac{\log(\text{number of pieces})}{\log(\text{magnification factor})}$$
> 
> Or equivalently:
> $$D = \frac{\log n}{\log(1/s)}$$

> [!example] Checking with known dimensions
> **Line (1D):** $s = 1/2 \Rightarrow n = 2, r = 2$
> $D = \frac{\log 2}{\log 2} = 1$ ✓
> 
> **Square (2D):** $s = 1/2 \Rightarrow n = 4, r = 2$
> $D = \frac{\log 4}{\log 2} = \frac{2 \log 2}{\log 2} = 2$ ✓
> 
> **Cube (3D):** $s = 1/2 \Rightarrow n = 8, r = 2$
> $D = \frac{\log 8}{\log 2} = \frac{3 \log 2}{\log 2} = 3$ ✓

For fractals, $D$ won't be a nice integer, it'll be something like 1.26 or 1.58, which is why they're called "fractional" dimensions.
