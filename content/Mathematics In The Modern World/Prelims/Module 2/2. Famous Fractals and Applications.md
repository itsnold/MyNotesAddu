## The Julia and Mandelbrot Sets

### Julia Set

Given some constant $c \in \mathbb{C}$, the forward iterations of a complex point $x_0$ are generated using:

$$x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + c$$

The Julia set is the boundary between points that escape to infinity and those that stay bounded.

### Mandelbrot Set

The **Mandelbrot set** is the set of values $c$ in the complex plane for which the orbit of $z = 0$ under $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ remains bounded.

> [!info] Famous Regions
> **Sea Horse Valley** — centered around $-0.75 + 0.1i$, spiral shapes resembling sea horse tails
> 
> **Elephant Valley** — centered around $0.3 + 0i$, rounded trunk-like shapes

Being a fractal, the entire Mandelbrot Set's shape appears again when zooming in on its boundary which is self-similarity at work.

## The Cantor Set

Named after **Georg Cantor** (1845–1918), the founder of set theory. It's often called the simplest fractal.

> [!info]+ 📊 Cantor Set Construction
> ![[attachments/cantor_set.png]]
> *Start with a line, remove the middle third, repeat forever*

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with a line segment
2. Divide into thirds
3. Remove the middle third
4. Iterate on remaining segments

The recurrence relation:
$$x_n = \left[ \frac{1}{3} x_{n-1} \right] \cup \left[ \frac{1}{3} x_{n-1} + \frac{2}{3} \right]$$

### Computing the Dimension

| Iteration $k$ | Copies $n_k$ | Length $s_k$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | $\frac{1}{3}$ |
| 2 | 4 | $\frac{1}{9}$ |
| 3 | 8 | $\frac{1}{27}$ |
| 4 | 16 | $\frac{1}{81}$ |

Pattern: $n_k = 2^k$ and $s_k = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^k$

**Calculating $D$:**

$$D = \frac{\ln n_k}{\ln(1/s_k)} = \frac{\ln 2^k}{\ln 3^k} = \frac{k \ln 2}{k \ln 3} = \frac{\ln 2}{\ln 3}$$

> [!abstract] Cantor Set Dimension
> $$D = \frac{\ln 2}{\ln 3} \approx 0.63$$

The $k$ cancels out, so the dimension is the same at every iteration.

## The Sierpinski Triangle

Named after Polish mathematician **Wacław Sierpiński**.

> [!info]+ 📊 Sierpinski Triangle Construction
> ![[attachments/sierpinski_triangle.png]]
> *Remove the center triangle, repeat on each remaining triangle*

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with an equilateral triangle
2. Connect the midpoints of each side to form a new triangle
3. Remove the center triangle
4. Repeat on each remaining triangle

### Computing the Dimension

| Iteration $k$ | Black Triangles $n_k$ | Side Length $s_k$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 3 | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| 2 | 9 | $\frac{1}{4}$ |
| 3 | 27 | $\frac{1}{8}$ |

Pattern: $n_k = 3^k$ and $s_k = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k$

**Calculating $D$:**

$$D = \frac{\ln n_k}{\ln(1/s_k)} = \frac{\ln 3^k}{\ln 2^k} = \frac{k \ln 3}{k \ln 2} = \frac{\ln 3}{\ln 2}$$

> [!abstract] Sierpinski Triangle Dimension
> $$D = \frac{\ln 3}{\ln 2} \approx 1.58$$

Between 1D and 2D — it has "more" than a line but "less" than a filled triangle.

## The Koch Snowflake

Created by Swedish mathematician **Niels Fabian Helge von Koch**. He used it to show that you can have a curve that's continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.

> [!info]+ 📊 Koch Edge Construction
> ![[attachments/koch_edge.png]]
> *Replace the middle third with a triangular bump, repeat*

**Algorithm (Koch Edge):**
1. Start with a line segment
2. Divide into 3 equal parts ($s = \frac{1}{3}$)
3. Replace middle part with two segments at 60° and 120° angles
4. Repeat on each segment

Apply this to each side of an equilateral triangle to get the snowflake.

### Computing the Dimension

| Iteration $k$ | Segments $n_k$ | Length $s_k$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 4 | $\frac{1}{3}$ |
| 2 | 16 | $\frac{1}{9}$ |
| 3 | 64 | $\frac{1}{27}$ |
| 4 | 256 | $\frac{1}{81}$ |

Pattern: $n_k = 4^k$ and $s_k = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^k$

**Calculating $D$:**

$$D = \frac{\ln n_k}{\ln(1/s_k)} = \frac{\ln 4^k}{\ln 3^k} = \frac{k \ln 4}{k \ln 3} = \frac{\ln 4}{\ln 3}$$

> [!abstract] Koch Snowflake Dimension
> $$D = \frac{\ln 4}{\ln 3} \approx 1.26$$

Between a 1D line and a 2D surface.

## Fractals in Nature and Applications

Nature has countless examples of fractals — plants, animals, and environmental phenomena exhibit iterative, recursive behavior.
