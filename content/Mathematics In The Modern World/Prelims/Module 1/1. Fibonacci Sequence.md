## Sequences

So, one of the best ways to describe events is through patterns. This section introduces (or refreshes) two ideas that are essential for understanding Fibonacci: sequences and recurrence relations.

> [!definition] Sequence
> A **sequence** is a function whose domain is a set of consecutive natural numbers and whose range is a set of real numbers.
> 
> Denoted as: $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n, \ldots$
> 
> $a_n$ is the $n$-th term of the sequence. The position of each term matters.
> 
> A sequence may be:
> - **Finite** — has a definite number of terms
> - **Infinite** — continues indefinitely

For example: $3, 6, 9, 12, \ldots, 3n, \ldots$ where $a_1 = 3$, $a_2 = 6$, $a_3 = 9$, $a_4 = 12$, and so on with $a_n = 3n$.

### Representing Sequences

There are several ways to represent a sequence:

> [!info] Representation Methods
> **1. Set Notation:** $\{a_n\} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$
> 
> **2. Listing Terms:** Just write out the terms: $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \ldots$
> 
> **3. Explicit Formula:** Give a formula for the $n$-th term, like $a_n = n^2$
> 
> **4. By Pattern:** Identify the pattern and describe it (arithmetic, geometric, etc.)

### Common Sequence Types

#### Arithmetic Sequence

Has a **common difference** $d$ between consecutive terms.

$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$

where $a_1$ is the first term and $d = a_2 - a_1$.

> [!example] Arithmetic Example
> $2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots$ has $a_1 = 2$ and $d = 3$
> 
> So $a_n = 2 + (n-1)(3) = 3n - 1$

#### Geometric Sequence

Has a **common ratio** $r$ between consecutive terms.

$$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$$

where $a_1$ is the first term and $r = \frac{a_2}{a_1}$.

> [!example] Geometric Example
> $3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots$ has $a_1 = 3$ and $r = 2$
> 
> So $a_n = 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}$

#### Harmonic Sequence

The reciprocals of an arithmetic sequence.

$$a_n = \frac{1}{a_1 + (n-1)d}$$

> [!example] Harmonic Example
> $1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots$ — the reciprocals of $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$

#### Fibonacci Sequence

Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

with $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$ (or sometimes $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$).

> [!example] Fibonacci Example
> $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, \ldots$

### Sequence Examples

> [!example] Example 1
> Write the first five terms of the sequence $b_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$.
> 
> **Working it out:**
> 
> For $n = 1$: $b_1 = \frac{(-1)^1}{1} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1$
> 
> For $n = 2$: $b_2 = \frac{(-1)^2}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$
> 
> For $n = 3$: $b_3 = \frac{(-1)^3}{3} = \frac{-1}{3} = -\frac{1}{3}$
> 
> For $n = 4$: $b_4 = \frac{(-1)^4}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$
> 
> For $n = 5$: $b_5 = \frac{(-1)^5}{5} = \frac{-1}{5} = -\frac{1}{5}$
> 
> **Answer:** $-1, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, -\frac{1}{5}$

> [!example] Example 2
> Consider the sequence $\{a_n\}$ where $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$. List the terms $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \ldots\}$.
> 
> **Working it out:**
> 
> $a_1 = \frac{1}{1} = 1$, $a_2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $a_3 = \frac{1}{3}$, $a_4 = \frac{1}{4}$, ...
> 
> **Answer:** $\{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots\}$

## Recurrence Relations

So far, sequences were described with explicit formulas for their terms. But you can provide one or more **initial terms** together with a rule for determining subsequent terms from the ones that came before.

For example, $a_n = 7 + a_{n-1}$. Notice there's an $a_{n-1}$ on the right side. This means $a_n$ is expressed in terms of the previous term $a_{n-1}$, plus the constant 7.

Given an initial term (called the **initial condition**), we can derive all terms of the sequence by recursively defining them using previous terms. This process is what we call a **recurrence relation**.

> [!definition] Recurrence Relation
> A recurrence relation for the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an equation that expresses $a_n$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms ($a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$), for all integers $n \geq n_0$, where $n_0$ is a nonnegative integer.
> 
> The **initial conditions** specify the terms before the recurrence relation takes effect.
> 
> The recurrence relation together with initial conditions **uniquely determines** the sequence.

> [!example] Example 3
> Let $\{a_n\}$ satisfy the recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3$ for $n \geq 1$ with $a_0 = 2$. Find $a_1, a_2, a_3$.
> 
> **Working it out:**
> 
> For $n = 1$: $a_1 = a_{1-1} + 3 = a_0 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$
> 
> For $n = 2$: $a_2 = a_{2-1} + 3 = a_1 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$
> 
> For $n = 3$: $a_3 = a_{3-1} + 3 = a_2 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11$
> 
> **Answer:** $a_1 = 5$, $a_2 = 8$, $a_3 = 11$

> [!example] Example 4
> Let $\{a_n\}$ satisfy the recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$ with $a_0 = 3$ and $a_1 = 5$. Find $a_2$ and $a_3$.
> 
> **Working it out:**
> 
> For $n = 2$: $a_2 = a_{2-1} - a_{2-2} = a_1 - a_0 = 5 - 3 = 2$
> 
> For $n = 3$: $a_3 = a_{3-1} - a_{3-2} = a_2 - a_1 = 2 - 5 = -3$
> 
> **Answer:** $a_2 = 2$, $a_3 = -3$

> [!tip] Why this matters for Fibonacci
> The Fibonacci sequence is defined by a recurrence relation: $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ with initial conditions $F_0 = 0$ (or $F_1 = 1$) and $F_1 = 1$. Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Understanding recurrence relations is the foundation for understanding how Fibonacci works.
