## About Fibonacci

> [!quote]+ Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)

> *Introduced this sequence in his book Liber Abaci (The Book of Calculating) in 1202.*

So, the **Fibonacci sequence** is named after Leonardo Pisano. Unlike arithmetic sequences (where there's a common difference $d$) or geometric sequences (common ratio $r$), Fibonacci works differently, each term depends on the two before it.

## The Rabbit Problem

To understand where Fibonacci comes from, there's this classic problem about rabbits.

> [!info] The Rules
> 1. All pairs consist of a male and female
> 2. One pair of newborn rabbits starts on January 1
> 3. When they're 2 months old, they produce a pair of babies
> 4. Every month after that, they produce another pair
> 5. All rabbits reproduce the same way
> 6. Rabbits don't die

Here's how it plays out month by month (numbers in brackets = age in months):

| Month | What's happening | Total Pairs |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| Jan 1 | [0] — just the original pair | 1 |
| Feb 1 | [1] — still growing | 1 |
| Mar 1 | [2] → [0] — first offspring! | 2 |
| Apr 1 | [3] → [1], [0] — another offspring | 3 |
| May 1 | [4] → [2], [1], [0], [0] — first offspring reproduces too | 5 |
| June 1 | [5] → [3], [2], [1], [1], [0], [0], [0] — more pairs hit 2 months | 8 |

So what's happening is:
- In Jan and Feb, the first pair is just growing up. Still 1 pair.
- By March, they're 2 months old so they have their first offspring. Now 2 pairs.
- April, the original pair produces again. 3 pairs.
- May, the first offspring is now 2 months old and produces too. 5 pairs.
- June, more pairs reach reproductive age. 8 pairs.

## Finding the Pattern

Looking at the counts: $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots$

For May (5 pairs): there were 3 pairs last month, plus 2 newborns = 5

For June (8 pairs): there were 5 pairs last month, plus 3 newborns = 8

The number of newborns this month equals the number of pairs from 2 months ago. That's because only pairs that are 2+ months old can reproduce.

> [!abstract] The Pattern
> $$\text{Pairs this month} = \text{Pairs last month} + \text{Pairs from 2 months ago}$$
> 
> In other words: **every term is the sum of the two preceding terms**.

The sequence continues: $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, \ldots$

## Fibonacci Definition

Like arithmetic and geometric sequences, Fibonacci is a **recursive sequence** — you need previous terms to find the next one.

> [!info] Comparing the Formulas
> | Sequence | Formula |
> |---|---|
> | Arithmetic | $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ |
> | Geometric | $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$ |
> | Fibonacci | $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ |

> [!definition] Fibonacci Sequence
> Initial conditions: $f_0 = 0$, $f_1 = 1$
> 
> Recurrence relation: $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$

> [!example] Finding Fibonacci Numbers
> Find $f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5, f_6$:
> 
> **Working it out:**
> 
> For $n = 2$: $f_2 = f_1 + f_0 = 1 + 0 = 1$
> 
> For $n = 3$: $f_3 = f_2 + f_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$
> 
> For $n = 4$: $f_4 = f_3 + f_2 = 2 + 1 = 3$
> 
> For $n = 5$: $f_5 = f_4 + f_3 = 3 + 2 = 5$
> 
> For $n = 6$: $f_6 = f_5 + f_4 = 5 + 3 = 8$
> 
> **Answer:** $f_2 = 1$, $f_3 = 2$, $f_4 = 3$, $f_5 = 5$, $f_6 = 8$

## The Golden Ratio

This covers the **Golden Ratio**, denoted by the Greek letter $\phi$ (phi).
### Phidias and the Golden Proportion

The symbol $\phi$ comes from **Phidias** (c. 480–430 BC), a Greek sculptor who supposedly used the golden proportion in his works, including the Parthenon. The idea is that certain proportions are more aesthetically pleasing than others.

> [!definition] The Golden Proportion
> A line is divided in the **golden ratio** when the ratio of the whole to the longer part equals the ratio of the longer part to the shorter part.
> 
> If the whole = $a + b$ and the longer part = $a$:
> $$\frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} = \phi$$

### Deriving Phi

Let's derive the actual value of $\phi$.

Starting with the golden proportion: $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a + b}{a}$

Let $\phi = \frac{a}{b}$. Then $a = \phi \cdot b$.

Substituting into $\frac{a + b}{a} = \phi$:

$$\frac{\phi b + b}{\phi b} = \phi$$

$$\frac{b(\phi + 1)}{\phi b} = \phi$$

$$\frac{\phi + 1}{\phi} = \phi$$

Multiply both sides by $\phi$:

$$\phi + 1 = \phi^2$$

Rearranging: $\phi^2 - \phi - 1 = 0$

Using the quadratic formula:

$$\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$$

(We take the positive root since $\phi$ is a ratio of lengths.)

> [!abstract] The Golden Ratio
> $$\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.6180339887...$$
> 
> It's irrational; the decimal goes on forever without repeating.

### Fibonacci and the Golden Ratio

This is where it connects to Fibonacci. If you take the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, it approaches $\phi$ as the numbers get larger:

| $n$ | $f_n$ | $f_{n+1}$ | $\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1.000 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 | 2.000 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 | 1.500 |
| 4 | 3 | 5 | 1.667 |
| 5 | 5 | 8 | 1.600 |
| 6 | 8 | 13 | 1.625 |
| 7 | 13 | 21 | 1.615 |
| 8 | 21 | 34 | 1.619 |

As $n \to \infty$, the ratio $\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n} \to \phi$.

> [!tip] Why this happens
> It comes from the recurrence relation. If you divide $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ by $f_{n-1}$, you get:
> $$\frac{f_n}{f_{n-1}} = 1 + \frac{f_{n-2}}{f_{n-1}}$$
> As $n$ gets large, both ratios approach $\phi$, giving $\phi = 1 + \frac{1}{\phi}$, which is the same equation we solved earlier.
