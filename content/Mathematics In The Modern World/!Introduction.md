## Grading System (Prelim / Midterm / Prefinal)

> [!info] Grading breakdown
> - Quizzes, Problem Sets, Formative Assessments, Oral Recitations — **40%**
> - Term Examination — **60%**

> [!tip] Notation
> - Let A = assessment score (Quizzes/Problem Sets/Formative/Oral), expressed out of 100.  
> - Let x = raw exam points, y = maximum exam points, so exam score E = $\dfrac{x}{y}\times100$.

> [!math] Formula (LaTeX)
> - Final grade:
> $$
> G \;=\; 0.40A \;+\; 0.60E
> $$
> - Substituting $E=\dfrac{x}{y}\times100$:
> $$
> G \;=\; 0.40A \;+\; 0.60\left(\dfrac{x}{y}\times100\right)
> $$

> [!important] Base‑40 (when assessments are full marks)
> - If $A=100$, the formula simplifies to:
> $$
> G \;=\; 40 \;+\; 60\cdot\frac{x}{y}
> $$

> [!example] Worked example
> - Suppose A = 85, exam $x=80$, $y=100$ (so $E=80$):
> $$
> G = 0.40(85) + 0.60(80) = 34 + 48 = 82
> $$
