## Language Registers

Register refers to the **level of formality** in language use. There are five levels:

> [!abstract] Five Language Registers
> | Register | Description | Example |
> |---|---|---|
> | **1. Frozen/Static** | Fixed, unchanging language | Pledges, prayers, laws |
> | **2. Formal** | Official, one-way, no interruption | Academic lectures, speeches |
> | **3. Consultative** | Professional, back-and-forth | Doctor-patient, teacher-student |
> | **4. Casual** | Informal, between friends | Slang, incomplete sentences |
> | **5. Intimate** | Private, between close people | Pet names, inside jokes |

> [!example] Register Examples
> **Frozen:** "I pledge allegiance to the flag..."
> 
> **Formal:** "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the conference."
> 
> **Consultative:** "How are you feeling today? Let's discuss your symptoms."
> 
> **Casual:** "Hey, wanna grab coffee later?"
> 
> **Intimate:** "Love you, see you tonight."

> [!tip] Matching Register to Context
> Using the wrong register can cause:
> - Misunderstanding
> - Offense
> - Perceived disrespect
> 
> Always consider your audience and setting!
