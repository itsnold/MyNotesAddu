# Topic A: Hollywood Marriage

## Question 1: What is it? Where did it come from?

So when people talk about "Hollywood Marriage," obviously they're referring to
- Marriages between high-profile celebrities

And are
- Defined by wealth, fame, and public scrutiny

- Often stereotyped as short-lived or superficial

Now, back in the 1920s through the 1950s, Hollywood studios functioned a bit like corporations that effectively *owned* their actors. And sometimes, the studios would conduct arrange marriages, and it's not because those members were in love however, but it's because it was good for public relations. If an actor got caught in a scandal, the studio they were under would marry them off to a co-star and the public would conveniently forget about whatever happened. 

These days, celebrities are free to marry whoever they want. But their relationships are still, in a lot of ways, heavily influenced by branding and also treated like business assets. This is because a "power couple" can boost ticket sales on their respective movies, land better brand deals, and stay on the headlines for weeks. In any case the romance might be genuine, but the marketing around it is extremely calculated for revenue.

## Question 2: What worldview drives it?

Now there are two things to take note here.

First is **individualism and careerism**. In Hollywood, a person's career often comes before everything else, including family. Both people in the relationship are usually chasing their own spotlight. Which is by no means a "bad thing", but it does put a huge strain on the marriage when both partners have demanding schedules.

Second is this tension between **romantic idealism and reality**. The media sells these fairy tale narratives. Often stating that they're so perfect together. and etc. But the reality is there are factors such as long-distance schedules, constant temptation, and the paparazzi that aren't really tackled enough at all.

## Question 3: How do we talk to these couples respectfully?

Now if you ever end up meeting one of these couples, the question is: how do you not come off like a weird fan or, an invasive reporter?

**Register:**  
Keep it professional but still casual. Treat them like peers and not like celebrities or people that are essentially above your social standing. Just people lang. You can talk about their *work*, their hobbies, and other aspects that aren't directly tied to their fame.

**What NOT to say:**
- "Is this relationship just a publicity stunt for your new movie?" (That's basically calling them liars to their face.)
- "Did you sign a prenup?" (Because that's way too personal)
-  Comparing them to their exes. "You look way happier than you did with them."
- Anything you read in a tabloid. Just don't mention it. (It is intrusive and even untrue at times)

## Question 4: Real-life examples

**Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton**  
This is the classic example people bring up. They married each other, divorced, and then married each other *again*. Volatile, passionate, and extremely expensive. They pretty much invented what we now call the "Hollywood Power Couple."

**Kim Kardashian & Kris Humphries**  
This one has become something of a meme. The marriage lasted 72 days. And it all played out on reality TV. People still reference this whenever short-lived celebrity marriages are discussed.

**Britney Spears & Jason Alexander**  
Vegas wedding, 55-hour annulment. That's not even three full days. Impulsive honestly doesn't even begin to describe it.

---

## Question 5: What's the marriage actually like?

**Public ownership.** People feel like they're *entitled* to have opinions about your relationship. And when you break up, the entire media picks sides.

**No privacy.** Now when these celebrities have intimate moments like at night, or when they have arguments or vacations, all of them are being photographed by the paparazzi.

**Competitive egos.** Both partners are usually A-listers. Both want the bigger role, the better deal, the more prestigious award. Sometimes they're so busy being successful individually that they barely see each other at all.

# Topic B: Same-Sex Marriage

## Question 1: What is it? Where did it come from?

Same-sex marriage is, as the name suggests, a legal marriage between two people of the same gender.

Getting here, though, wasn't easy. For a long time, being gay was criminalized. It was treated like a crime, even treated like a mental illness. The modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights really kicked off with the **Stonewall Riots in 1969**, which served as a turning point where the community collectively said, "Enough."

The Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001. In the US, it took until 2015, when the Supreme Court ruled on *Obergefell v. Hodges*, to make it a federal right. That's honestly not that long ago when you think about it.

---

## Question 2: What worldview drives it?

**Egalitarianism.** The belief that everyone deserves the same rights. Things like taxes, inheritance, hospital visitation. These are things straight couples take for granted. The argument is: why should someone be denied access to their dying spouse just because they're both men?

**Secularism and humanism.** Civil marriage, from this perspective, is a human right. It's a government contract, not a religious sacrament. You can believe whatever you want about marriage spiritually, but legally, everyone should be treated equally.

---

## Question 3: How do we talk to these couples respectfully?

**Register:**  
Be inclusive and open. Treat their marriage as *normal*, because it is. Don't act shocked. Don't treat them like some kind of curiosity to be studied.

If you don't know what terms they use, just say "partner" or "spouse" until they tell you what they prefer. Simple enough.

If you want to ask questions, frame them around their journey, their support system, their experiences. Not the mechanics of their relationship.

**What NOT to say:**
- "Who's the man and who's the woman?" (There isn't one. That's kinda the point. This question is offensive because it forces heteronormative roles onto relationships that don't function that way.)
- "How do you... you know... have sex?" (Would you ask a straight couple that? No, you wouldn't.)
- "When did you decide to be gay?" (Being gay isn't a decision. It's not a lifestyle choice someone made in college.)

## Question 4: Real-life examples

**Ellen DeGeneres & Portia de Rossi**  
Probably the most visible same-sex couple in American media. Ellen came out in the 90s when it was still considered career suicide to do so. This couple has done a lot to normalize LGBTQ+ relationships for mainstream audiences.

**Elton John & David Furnish**  
One of the first couples to legally register a civil partnership in the UK. They've been major advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and families for years.

**Neil Patrick Harris & David Burtka**  
They're raising twins. Publicly. Unapologetically. They've shown America that gay parents are just, well, parents.

---

## Question 5: What's the marriage actually like?

**Negotiated roles.** There's no default "husband does this, wife does that." Everything, from chores to finances, gets discussed and split based on who's actually better at what. It's practical, not prescribed by society.

**Resilience.** These couples often went through *a lot* together before they could even get married legally. That shared struggle tends to create a bond that's difficult to break.

**Chosen family.** Sometimes, biological families don't accept them. So they build their own. Close friends who act like siblings, aunts, uncles. The support system is real, even if it's not by blood.
