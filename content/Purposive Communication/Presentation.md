# The Hybels-Weaver Communication Model

> [!abstract] Overview
> Communication is similar to dancing. Two people are moving together, responding to each other in real time, adjusting and adapting as they go. That's exactly what Hybels and Weaver were trying to capture when they developed this model.

## A Bit of History

> [!info] Origins
> **Saundra Hybels** and **Richard L. Weaver II** introduced this model in the late 1980s through their textbook *Communicating Effectively*.

Before them, most people thought of communication the way engineers thought of radio signals. You have a sender, a message, and a receiver. Done. The Shannon-Weaver model from 1948 worked exactly like that.

But Hybels and Weaver noticed something obvious that everyone else overlooked: humans aren't radios. When you talk to someone, you're not just broadcasting. You're watching their face, catching their reactions, adjusting your words mid-sentence. They're doing the same to you. It's messy, it's alive, and it never stops.

## The Building Blocks

> [!tip] Communicators
> Both senders and receivers at once. While you're talking, you're also reading the other person's expression. While you're listening, you're nodding, frowning, or looking confused. Everyone in a conversation is constantly doing both.

> [!example] Encoding
> How you turn a thought into something shareable. You pick words, gestures, a tone of voice. If you're excited, maybe you talk faster or wave your hands around.

> [!example] Decoding
> Happens on the other end. The listener takes those signals and tries to figure out what you actually meant. Problem is, they're filtering everything through their own experiences, their culture, their assumptions. This is why telling a joke to someone from a different background can fall completely flat even when the words translate perfectly.

> [!note] The Message
> This is the content or idea being shared. It covers words, tone, body language, timing, even silences. All of it counts.

> [!note] Channels
> These are how messages travel. Sight, sound, touch. A text message and a face-to-face conversation carry the same words very differently.

> [!success] Feedback
> What turns a monologue into an actual conversation. A nod. A question. A confused look. Without it, you're just talking at someone.

> [!warning] Noise
> is  anything that distorts the message.. It comes in three types:
> 
> | Type | Description |
> |---|---|
> | **Physical** | Literal distractions. Construction outside, bad phone signal. |
> | **Psychological** | What's happening in your head. Stress, bias, your mind wandering. |
> | **Semantic** | Language problems. Jargon, unfamiliar words, terms that mean different things to different people. |

> [!important] Context
> Shapes everything. The same words hit differently depending on where you are, who you're with, and what's happening around you. "We need to talk" from your professor means something very different than from your partner.
