# 📢 Types of Communication

> [!abstract] Overview
> Communication can be classified based on **two primary dimensions**: the *size of the receiver* (how many people are involved) and the *medium used* (the channel through which the message travels). Understanding these distinctions helps us adapt our communication style for maximum effectiveness.

## 👥 By Size of the Receiver

> [!note]+ Intrapersonal Communication
> **Definition:** Communication *with yourself*.
> 
> This includes your internal monologue, self-reflection, and the thinking process you use to work through problems or make decisions.
> 
> > [!example]+ Examples
> > - Journaling your thoughts
> > - Weighing pros and cons before a decision
> > - Mental rehearsal before a speech
> > - Self-talk during stressful situations

> [!note]+ Interpersonal Communication
> **Definition:** Communication *between two people* or a small handful.
> 
> This is the most common form of communication in daily life. It allows for immediate feedback, clarification, and a natural back-and-forth exchange.
> 
> > [!example]+ Examples
> > - A conversation with a friend
> > - A one-on-one meeting with a professor
> > - Texting someone about weekend plans

> [!note]+ Small Group Communication
> **Definition:** Communication among approximately *4 to 10 people*.
> 
> Found in meetings, study groups, and team discussions. Everyone can still participate directly, but the dynamics become more complex as group size increases.
> 
> > [!example]+ Examples

> [!note]+ Mass Communication
> **Definition:** Communication transmitted through *mass media* to a *large, dispersed audience*.
> 
> Unlike public communication, the sender and receivers are typically separated by distance and time. Messages are produced by organizations and distributed through technological channels. Feedback is minimal, delayed, or indirect (ratings, comments, shares).
> 
> > [!info]+ Important Characteristics
> > - **One-to-many** — a single source reaches thousands or millions
> > - **Mediated** — relies on technology (print, broadcast, digital)
> > - **Anonymous audience** — the sender doesn't know individual receivers
> > - **Gatekeeping** — editors, producers, and algorithms filter content
> > - **Delayed feedback** — responses come through ratings, reviews, or social media
> 
> > [!example]+ Examples
> > - Television news broadcasts
> > - Newspaper and magazine articles
> > - Radio programs and podcasts
> > - Social media posts that go viral
