## What is Purposive Communication

> [!definition] Purposive Communication
> **Intentional and goal-directed communication** designed to achieve a specific purpose or outcome.
> 
> Key characteristics:
> - **Deliberate** — done on purpose
> - **Conscious** — aware of what you're doing
> - **End in mind** — clear goal or objective

### What Happens Without Purpose?

When communication isn't purposeful, problems arise:

| Situation | Example |
|---|---|
| Casual Conversations | Offhand comments or jokes that might offend someone without realizing it |
| Emotional Reactions | Yelling at a friend out of frustration without considering how it affects the relationship |
| Texting/Social Media | Posting comments that are misinterpreted due to lack of context or emotive cues |

## Nature of Communication

> [!info] Origin
> From Latin *comunicare* — "to share"

> [!quote] Definition (Hybels & Weaver, 2001)
> "Any process in which people share information, ideas, and feelings."

### What's Easy About Communication?

1. We communicate all the time, often without thinking — it comes naturally to us
2. Sometimes connecting with people just goes well

### What's Hard About Communication?

Despite communicating all the time:
- It's never quite as easy as we wish
- Connecting with some people feels like a real challenge
- Despite any effort, true connection might never happen

## Three Components of Communication

> [!abstract] The Three Components
> **1. ACTION** — involves sending and receiving (roles played)
> 
> **2. TRANSACTION** — sending a message through a channel (exchange)
> 
> **3. INTERACTION** — continuous back-and-forth exchange

## Why Miscommunication Happens

Even knowing what communication is, we still miscommunicate. Why?

> [!warning] Common Causes
> **Assumption of understanding** — People assume they know what others mean, or assume others know what they mean.
> 
> **Selective hearing** — People interpret conversations in ways that contribute to their already established beliefs.

> [!tip] Balance Hard and Soft Skills
> We need both:
> - **Hard skills** — technical knowledge, grammar, vocabulary
> - **Soft skills** — empathy, active listening, emotional awareness
