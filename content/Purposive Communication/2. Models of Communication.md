## 1 — Aristotle's Model

The earliest basic **persuasive communication** model.

> [!info]+ 📊 Aristotle's Model
> ![[attachments/aristotle_model.png]]
> *Speaker → Subject/Speech → Audience*

> [!abstract] The Core Triangle
> - **Speaker** — the person who speaks
> - **Subject** — the speech produced
> - **Audience** — the person who listens

> [!info] The Five Steps to Success
> 1. **Invention** — finding the content
> 2. **Organization** — arranging material logically
> 3. **Language** — style chosen to reach the audience
> 4. **Memory** — practice and retention
> 5. **Delivery** — the actual presentation

**Situational Factor:** The *setting* (external environment) affects how the audience receives the message.

## 2 — Lasswell's Model

A social scientific framework (1948) often used for **political symbolism and propaganda**.

> [!info]+ 📊 Lasswell's Model
> ![[attachments/lasswell_model.png]]
> *Linear, one-way communication with no feedback*

> [!abstract] The 6-Question Sequence
> 1. **Who?** — The Communicator
> 2. **Says What?** — The Message
> 3. **In Which Channel?** — The Medium
> 4. **To Whom?** — The Receiver
> 5. **Under What Circumstances?** — The Setting
> 6. **With What Effects?** — The Outcome/Impact

**Model Type:** Linear, one-way — no feedback loop.

## 3 — Shannon and Weaver's Model

A technical framework (1949) designed for **electronic media and signal accuracy**.

> [!info]+ 📊 Shannon and Weaver's Model
> ![[attachments/shannon_weaver_model.png]]
> *Info Source → Transmitter → Channel (+ Noise) → Receiver → Destination*

> [!abstract] The Signal Path
> Info Source → Transmitter → Channel (Noise Source) → Receiver → Destination

> [!info] Technical Glossary
> - **Noise** — unwanted disturbances (like static on a phone)
> - **Entropy** — freedom of choice in selecting a message
> - **Redundancy** — repeating info to ensure it's received
> - **Channel Capacity** — max info transmitted per unit of time

**Primary Goal:** Reducing uncertainty and minimizing noise.

## 4 — Schramm's Model

A continuous process focused on **interpretation and shared meaning**.

> [!info]+ 📊 Schramm's Model
> ![[attachments/schramm_model.png]]
> *Overlapping fields of experience enable shared meaning*

> [!abstract] The Circular Process
> Encoder/Source → Signal → Decoder/Destination → Feedback → (loop back)

> [!definition] Field of Experience
> Visualized as overlapping circles. "Maximum output" occurs only when source and receiver are **tuned together** based on shared orientations and past wisdom.

**Key Dynamic:**
- **Feedback** — communication is reciprocal; participants interchange roles
- **Meaning** — influenced by context and culture

## 5 — Berlo's SMCR Model

A behavioral model (1960) emphasizing **human variables and the five senses**.

> [!info]+ 📊 Berlo's SMCR Model
> ![[attachments/berlo_model.png]]
> *Source → Message → Channel (5 senses) → Receiver*

> [!abstract] The Four Pillars
> | S — Source | M — Message | C — Channel | R — Receiver |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Originator of ideas | Content, code, treatment | 5 senses | Target who decodes |

> [!info] Influencing Factors (for both S and R)
> - Communication Skills
> - Attitudes
> - Knowledge
> - Social Systems
> - Culture

**Strength:** Treats communication as a continuous two-way process where feedback minimizes noise.

## 6 — Lievrouw and Finn's Model

A 3D matrix (1990) designed to **bridge interpersonal and mass communication**.

> [!abstract] The Three Dimensions
> 1. **Control** — balance of power between sender and receiver
> 2. **Involvement** — physical or psychological distance (high vs. low)
> 3. **Temporality** — simultaneous (live) vs. nonsimultaneous interaction

> [!info] Core Argument
> All communication is **mediated** — either by technology or the human senses.

**Spectrum:** Maps systems from Face-to-Face Interaction (1) to Database Systems (14).

## 7 — Foulger's Ecological Model

A reflexive model (2004) where **roles shift based on the media environment**.

> [!abstract] Fluid Roles
> - Participants are both **Creators** and **Consumers**
> - Roles are **reflexive**: people learn to create by consuming others' messages

> [!info] Environmental Rules
> 1. Messages are created/consumed using **Language**
> 2. Language occurs within the context of **Media**
> 3. People invent and evolve the media they use

> [!warning] Reality Check
> - **Subjectivity** — interpretation is always imperfect due to language/media limits
> - **Selective Attention** — consumers choose from a multiplicity of messages
