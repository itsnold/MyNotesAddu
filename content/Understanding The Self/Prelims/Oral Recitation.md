## Socrates
**(470–399 BCE)** Greek philosopher, teacher of Plato

The guy who started Western philosophy. Never wrote anything down, so we only know him through Plato's writings.

> [!info] The Socratic Method
> Instead of lecturing, Socrates taught by asking questions. He'd keep asking "why?" and "what do you mean?" until the person realized their own contradictions.
> 
> | Step | What happens |
> |---|---|
> | 1. Claim | Someone makes a statement |
> | 2. Question | Socrates asks for clarification |
> | 3. Contradiction | The person's logic falls apart |
> | 4. Revised understanding | They arrive at better knowledge |

> [!abstract] Know Thyself
> Socrates believed self-examination was the highest pursuit. "The unexamined life is not worth living."

> [!abstract] Virtue = Knowledge
> If you truly understand what is good, you will do good. No one does evil willingly. People only do wrong because they're ignorant of what's truly good.

> [!warning] Death
> Executed by Athens for "corrupting the youth" and impiety. Refused to escape and drank poison hemlock.

## Plato
**(428–348 BCE)** Student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle

Founded the Academy in Athens. Wrote dialogues featuring Socrates as the main character.

> [!info] Theory of Forms
> The physical world we see is just an imperfect copy of a higher realm of perfect, eternal **Forms** (or Ideas).
> 
> | Physical World | World of Forms |
> |---|---|
> | Many chairs | One perfect "Chair" |
> | Changing, imperfect | Eternal, perfect |
> | Known through senses | Known through reason |
> 
> Every beautiful thing participates in the Form of Beauty itself. True knowledge is knowledge of these Forms.

> [!info] Allegory of the Cave
> Imagine prisoners chained in a cave since birth, facing a wall. Behind them is a fire, and people walk by carrying objects. The prisoners only see shadows on the wall and think that's reality.
> 
> | Stage | Represents |
> |---|---|
> | Prisoners in cave | Ordinary people, ignorant |
> | Shadows on wall | Physical world (illusions) |
> | Escaping the cave | Education, philosophy |
> | Seeing the sun | Knowing the Form of the Good |
> | Returning to cave | Philosopher teaching others |
> 
> The escaped prisoner sees truth but when he returns, the others don't believe him.

> [!abstract] Tripartite Soul
> The soul has three parts:
> 
> | Part | Function | Seeks | Virtue |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | **Reason** | Thinking, logic | Truth | Wisdom |
> | **Spirit** | Emotions, willpower | Honor | Courage |
> | **Appetite** | Desires, bodily needs | Pleasure | Temperance |
> 
> **Justice** = when Reason rules over Spirit and Appetite. Like a charioteer (Reason) controlling two horses (Spirit and Appetite).

> [!tip] Philosopher-King
> In *The Republic*, Plato argued that ideal rulers are philosopher-kings who understand the Forms and can govern wisely.

## Aristotle
**(384–322 BCE)** Student of Plato, tutor of Alexander the Great

Unlike Plato, Aristotle focused on the physical world. Founded the Lyceum. Wrote on everything from biology to ethics to logic.

> [!abstract] Virtue Ethics and Eudaimonia
> The goal of life is **eudaimonia** (flourishing, happiness, well-being). You achieve it by developing virtues through practice. Virtue is a habit, not just knowledge.

> [!info] The Golden Mean
> Every virtue is the balance point between two extremes (vices):
> 
> | Vice (Deficiency) | Virtue (Mean) | Vice (Excess) |
> |---|---|---|
> | Cowardice | **Courage** | Recklessness |
> | Stinginess | **Generosity** | Wastefulness |
> | Self-deprecation | **Honesty** | Boastfulness |
> | Shyness | **Friendliness** | Flattery |

> [!info] Four Causes
> To truly understand anything, you need to know four things:
> 
> | Cause | Question | Example (Statue) |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Material** | What is it made of? | Marble |
> | **Formal** | What is its shape/design? | Human figure |
> | **Efficient** | What made it? | The sculptor |
> | **Final** | What is its purpose? | To honor someone |

> [!abstract] Potentiality and Actuality
> Everything has **potential** that can become **actual**.
> - An acorn has the potential to become an oak tree (its actuality)
> - A student has potential to become a doctor

> [!abstract] Empiricism
> Knowledge comes from sensory experience of the physical world, not from abstract Forms like Plato thought.

## St. Augustine
**(354–430 CE)** Christian theologian, Bishop of Hippo

Converted to Christianity after a wild youth. Combined Christian faith with Greek philosophy.

> [!abstract] Original Sin
> All humans inherit Adam and Eve's sin from the Fall. We're born with a fallen nature inclined toward evil. Only divine grace can save us.

> [!info] Problem of Evil
> If God is all-good and all-powerful, why does evil exist?
> 
> Augustine's answer:
> 1. Evil is not a "thing" but an **absence of good** (like darkness is absence of light)
> 2. God gave humans **free will**
> 3. Humans chose to turn away from God
> 4. Evil results from misuse of free will, not from God

> [!abstract] Divine Illumination
> Human reason alone cannot reach ultimate truth. God must illuminate our minds, like the sun illuminates objects so we can see them.

> [!info] City of God vs. City of Man
> Two metaphorical cities exist throughout history:
> 
> | City of God | City of Man |
> |---|---|
> | Love of God | Love of self/worldly things |
> | Leads to heaven | Leads to destruction |
> | Pilgrim on earth | Attached to earth |

## St. Thomas Aquinas
**(1225–1274)** Dominican friar, Doctor of the Church

Synthesized Aristotle's philosophy with Christian theology.

> [!info] Five Ways (Proofs for God)
> | Way | Argument |
> |---|---|
> | **Motion** | Things move; something must have started all motion → First Mover (God) |
> | **Causation** | Everything has a cause; there must be a First Cause |
> | **Contingency** | Things exist but don't have to; there must be a Necessary Being |
> | **Gradation** | Things have degrees of perfection; there must be a Perfect Being as standard |
> | **Design** | Natural things act toward purposes; there must be an Intelligent Designer |

> [!abstract] Natural Law
> Moral law is built into nature and can be discovered through reason. Humans naturally incline toward:
> - Self-preservation
> - Procreation
> - Seeking truth
> - Living in society

> [!abstract] Faith and Reason
> Both are valid paths to truth and don't contradict each other. Reason can prove some truths (God's existence), while others require faith (the Trinity).

## René Descartes
**(1596–1650)** French philosopher, mathematician

Father of Modern Philosophy. Also invented Cartesian coordinates.

> [!abstract] Methodological Doubt
> To find absolutely certain knowledge, doubt everything that can possibly be doubted:
> - Senses can deceive (optical illusions)
> - You might be dreaming
> - An evil demon might be tricking you

> [!info] Cogito, Ergo Sum
> "I think, therefore I am."
> 
> Even if everything else is doubtful, the very act of doubting proves that I exist as a thinking thing. This is the one indubitable truth.
> 
> *The Logic: To doubt, I must think. To think, I must exist. Therefore, I exist.*

> [!info] Mind-Body Dualism
> | Mind (Res Cogitans) | Body (Res Extensa) |
> |---|---|
> | Thinking substance | Extended substance |
> | Non-physical | Physical, mechanical |
> | Free will | Follows laws of physics |
> 
> They interact through the pineal gland in the brain.

> [!abstract] Rationalism
> True knowledge comes from reason, not the senses. Innate ideas (like God, mathematical truths) exist within us from birth.

---

## John Locke
**(1632–1704)** English philosopher

Father of Liberalism. Influenced American founding fathers.

> [!abstract] Tabula Rasa
> The mind at birth is a **blank slate** (white paper). There are no innate ideas. All knowledge comes from experience.

> [!info] Empiricism
> All ideas come from two sources:
> 
> | Source | Type | Example |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Sensation** | External experience | Seeing red, feeling heat |
> | **Reflection** | Internal experience | Awareness of thinking, willing |

> [!info] Primary vs. Secondary Qualities
> | Primary (Objective) | Secondary (Subjective) |
> |---|---|
> | In the object itself | In the observer's perception |
> | Size, shape, motion | Color, taste, smell, sound |
> | Would exist without observer | Depend on observer |

> [!abstract] Natural Rights
> All humans possess inherent rights that exist before government:
> - **Life**
> - **Liberty**
> - **Property**

> [!abstract] Social Contract
> People form governments by consent to protect natural rights. If government fails or becomes tyrannical, the people have the right to overthrow it.

## David Hume
**(1711–1776)** Scottish philosopher

Radical empiricist and skeptic. Took Locke's ideas to extreme conclusions.

> [!info] Impressions vs. Ideas
> | Impressions | Ideas |
> |---|---|
> | Vivid, immediate | Faint copies |
> | Direct sensory experience | Recalled in memory |
> | Original | Derived from impressions |
> 
> All legitimate ideas must trace back to impressions. If not, it's meaningless.

> [!abstract] Problem of Induction
> We assume the future will resemble the past (the sun will rise tomorrow because it always has). But this cannot be rationally justified. It's just habit and custom.

> [!info] Causation as Habit
> We never actually perceive causation. We see:
> 1. Event A happens
> 2. Event B follows
> 3. This repeats many times
> 4. Our mind forms a habit of expecting B after A
> 
> Causation is a mental projection, not an observable fact.

> [!abstract] Bundle Theory of Self
> There is no permanent, unified "self." When you introspect, you find only a bundle of perceptions (thoughts, feelings, sensations) in constant flux. The "self" is a useful fiction.

> [!abstract] Is-Ought Problem
> You cannot derive moral conclusions ("ought") from factual premises ("is"). Just because something is natural doesn't mean it ought to be.

---

## Immanuel Kant
**(1724–1804)** German philosopher

Said Hume "awakened him from his dogmatic slumber." Synthesized rationalism and empiricism.

> [!abstract] Copernican Revolution in Philosophy
> Instead of asking how our knowledge conforms to objects, ask how objects conform to our minds. The mind actively shapes experience.

> [!info] Categories of Understanding
> The mind has built-in categories that organize raw sensory data:
> - Causality
> - Substance
> - Unity
> - Plurality
> 
> We cannot experience the world without these mental filters.

> [!info] Phenomena vs. Noumena
> | Phenomena | Noumena |
> |---|---|
> | Things as they appear to us | Things-in-themselves |
> | Filtered through mental categories | Beyond our experience |
> | Knowable | Unknowable |
> 
> We can only know phenomena, never noumena.

> [!info] Categorical Imperative
> The supreme principle of morality:
> 
> | Formulation | Meaning |
> |---|---|
> | Universal Law | Act only by maxims you could will to be universal laws |
> | Humanity | Treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means |
> 
> *Example: "Is lying wrong?" → Imagine if everyone lied → Trust collapses, lying wouldn't work → Contradiction → Lying is wrong*

> [!abstract] Duty and Good Will
> The only thing truly good is a **good will**. Acting from duty, not from inclination or self-interest. Moral worth comes from intention, not consequences.

---

## Sigmund Freud
**(1856–1939)** Austrian neurologist, Father of Psychoanalysis

Revolutionized how we understand the mind with his theory of the unconscious.

> [!info] Levels of Consciousness (Iceberg Model)
> Freud compared the mind to an iceberg:
> 
> | Level | Description | Accessibility |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Conscious** | What you're aware of right now (thoughts, perceptions) | Fully accessible |
> | **Preconscious** | Memories/info not currently in awareness but can be recalled | Accessible with effort |
> | **Unconscious** | Repressed memories, forbidden desires, instincts | Not directly accessible |
> 
> The conscious is just the tip of the iceberg. Most of your mind is hidden below the surface.

> [!abstract] The Unconscious Mind
> Most mental activity occurs below conscious awareness. Repressed memories, desires, and traumas influence our behavior without us knowing.

> [!info] Structure of the Psyche
> | Part | Principle | Function | Consciousness |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | **Id** | Pleasure | Primitive instincts, seeks immediate gratification | Entirely unconscious |
> | **Ego** | Reality | Mediates between id and superego | Partly conscious |
> | **Superego** | Morality | Internalized rules, conscience, guilt | Partly conscious |
> 
> Mental life is a constant struggle among these three. The ego tries to satisfy the id's demands in realistic ways while meeting the superego's moral standards.

> [!info] Psychosexual Stages
> Personality develops through stages focused on different erogenous zones:
> 
> | Stage | Age | Focus | Fixation Results |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | **Oral** | 0–1 | Mouth (sucking, feeding) | Dependency, smoking, overeating |
> | **Anal** | 1–3 | Bowel control | Orderliness vs. messiness |
> | **Phallic** | 3–6 | Genitals, Oedipus complex | Gender identity issues |
> | **Latency** | 6–puberty | Sexual feelings dormant | — |
> | **Genital** | Puberty+ | Mature sexuality | Healthy adult relationships |
> 
> Getting stuck (fixated) at any stage causes personality problems in adulthood.

> [!info] Oedipus and Electra Complex
> During the phallic stage:
> - **Boys** (Oedipus): unconsciously desire mother, see father as rival. Resolved by identifying with father.
> - **Girls** (Electra): desire father, rivalry with mother.

> [!info] Defense Mechanisms
> The ego protects itself from anxiety using unconscious strategies:
> 
> | Mechanism | What it does | Example |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Repression** | Pushes threatening thoughts into unconscious | Forgetting traumatic events |
> | **Denial** | Refuses to accept reality | "This isn't happening" |
> | **Projection** | Attributes your feelings to others | Cheater accuses partner of cheating |
> | **Rationalization** | Creates logical excuses | "I failed because the test was unfair" |
> | **Displacement** | Redirects emotions to safer target | Yelling at family after bad day at work |
> | **Sublimation** | Channels impulses into acceptable activities | Aggression → sports |

> [!info] Dream Analysis
> Dreams are the "royal road to the unconscious."
> 
> | Content | Description |
> |---|---|
> | **Manifest** | The literal storyline you remember |
> | **Latent** | The hidden, symbolic meaning (repressed wishes) |

> [!info] Life and Death Instincts
> | Eros (Life) | Thanatos (Death) |
> |---|---|
> | Survival, pleasure, reproduction | Destruction, aggression |
> | Pushes toward life | Pushes toward death, self-destruction |

> [!abstract] Free Association
> Therapeutic technique where patients say whatever comes to mind without censoring, revealing unconscious connections.
