A **sequence** is a function whose domain is a set of consecutive natural numbers and whose range is a set of real numbers. It is denoted as:

$$a_1, a_2, a3, ..., a_n, ...$$
$$ n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 $$
$a_n$ is the $n$-th term of the sequence
The position of each term is important
A sequence may be finite (has definite number of terms) or infintie (continues indefinitely).

Reoresenting Sequences
1. Set Notation: ${a_n} = {a_1, a_2, a_3}$
(fill in)




By Pattern:
Arithmetic Sequence - common difference d
$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) d$$
Geometric Sequence - common ratio

(there are other formulas here i didnt have the to fill in)
